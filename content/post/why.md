I am a student. In my first year I was in awe of 2 of my seniors, one studying Artificial Intelligence and the other Business, whose brilliance in thinking and execution inspired some of us to do more, and to be better.

They've both graduated now and I'm in the final year of my studies. Going through the education cycle, I've come to see we have universities in which students' ability to think and reason have been crippled by primary education systems. 

That's bad.

So when my friend from Econs faculty told me recently he had decided to do something about campus journalism, through technology, I happily accepted to join him to give this a try together, to find more students who _think_. 
A difficult journey, since the ones who do _think_ are just too quiet. That's natural, chaos is noisy, but brilliant thoughts often go unheard. For every _confession_ on our universities' _confession pages_, chances of coming across intellectually amazing content written by a low profile young student is little to none.
### We don't understand why,
but we care to do something about it. Because _statistically_ there must exist students who have great minds and remarkable thoughts, and if we don't get to hear about them enough or we don't often see their opinions on social media, it must be because we're just not close enough. Here's a little attempt in bringing us closer, to be loud and clear and share opinions that need to be heard. 
### Crowdsourcing brilliant thinking
We're building Campus Journalist to find students who are _still_ capable of generating original ideas and/or operate brilliantly on those ideas; and let them be heard. 

I study Artificial Intelligence, my friend studies Econs. We're university students in Malaysia, and it genuinely bothers us that _Confessions_ pages are the biggest sources of original content that our students create and/or contribute to. 
We're driven by the notion that we all grow more when we are surrounded by brilliant minds, so mathematically it's wise to preach brilliance in thinking and execution. That's what we are, and that's what The Campus Journalist stands for.

### Join us as a writer
