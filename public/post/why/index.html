      <div class="content">
        

<p>I am a student. In my first year I was in awe of 2 of my seniors, one studying Artificial Intelligence and the other Business, whose brilliance in thinking and execution inspired some of us to do more, and to be better.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve both graduated now and I&rsquo;m in final year of studies. Going through the education cycle, I&rsquo;ve come to see we have universities in which students&rsquo; ability to think and reason have been crippled by primary education systems.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s bad.</p>

<p>So when my friend from Econs faculty told me recently he had decided to do something about campus journalism, through technology, I happily accepted to join him to give this a try together, to find more students who <em>think</em>.
A difficult journey, since the ones who do <em>think</em> are just too quiet. That&rsquo;s natural, chaos is noisy, but brilliant thoughts often go unheard. For every <em>confession</em> on our universities&rsquo; <em>confession pages</em>, chances of coming across intellectually amazing content written by a low profile young student is little to none.</p>

<h3 id="we-don-t-understand-why">We don&rsquo;t understand why,</h3>

<p>but we care to do something about it. Because <em>statistically</em> there must exist students who have great minds and remarkable thoughts, and if we don&rsquo;t get to hear about them enough or we don&rsquo;t often see their opinions on social media, it must be because we&rsquo;re just not close enough. Here&rsquo;s a little attempt in bringing us closer, to be loud and clear and share opinions that need to be heard.</p>

<h3 id="crowdsourcing-brilliant-thinking">Crowdsourcing brilliant thinking</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re building Campus Journalist to find students who are <em>still</em> capable of generating original ideas and/or operate brilliantly on those ideas; and let them be heard.</p>

<p>I study Artificial Intelligence, my friend studies Econs. We&rsquo;re university students in Malaysia, and it genuinely bothers us that <em>Confessions</em> pages are the biggest sources of original content that our students create and/or contribute to.
We&rsquo;re driven by the notion that We all grow more when we are surrounded by brilliant minds, so mathematically it&rsquo;s wise to preach brilliance in thinking and execution. That&rsquo;s what we are, and that&rsquo;s what The Campus Journalist stands for.</p>

<h3 id="join-us-as-a-writer">Join us as a writer</h3>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t build this website so we could write more, we built it so <em>you</em> could write more! If you&rsquo;re interested in sharing their opinions on <strong>student affairs</strong>, <a href="https://www.messenger.com/t/thecampusjournalist">drop us a message</a>, we&rsquo;ll get back to you fast.</p>
